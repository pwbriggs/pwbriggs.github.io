I have `briggs.seattle.wa.us`, and you might be able to get one for yourself, with your own city and state, if you're in the US! They're free, too. I had success following [Frederick Chan's great guide](https://fredchan.org/blog/locality-domains-guide/), but your mileage may vary, especially depending on what city you want your domain to contain.
